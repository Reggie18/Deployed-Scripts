# Deployed-Scripts
This is a repository of my work that is currently being managed by a cloud service

The scripts here were mainly written in vscode using various libraries like selenium(mainly), requests and beautifulsoup4. 

I adapted them to scrape to google sheets utilising gsspread to be used asa a backend for another site. In order to ensure continuous scraping,
I timed it to scrape every hour after a complete navigation cycle. I finally deployed it on heroku to make use of their cloud servers.
